# **1. Abstract**

 It was 1971 when **Ray Tomlinson** invented and developed electronic mail. By 1993 the term “electronic mail” had been replaced by “email”. Over the next few years, America Online (AOL), Echomail, Hotmail, and Yahoo shaped the internet and email landscape. In the late 1990’s, internet use exploded, growing from 55 million users worldwide in 1997 to 400 million by 1999. However as the market potential of the internet grew, email spam from unscrupulous actors multiplied exponentially.

Today, email is a primary means of communication for many people worldwide. 

The average daily volume of emails sent globally in 2021 is 122.33 billion. However, 85% of those emails are spam.

* 36% of spam consists of advertising.
* 31.7% of spam consists of adult content.
* 26.5% of spam is financially motivated.

Email spam costs businesses a whopping $20.5 billion every year. (Radicati Group, Nucleus Research). Spammers can send as many messages as they want to whatever email address they have.

</p>

Email providers and users have come to terms with the reality of spam—we filter it out, spam creators and bots figure out a way around it, we find a fix, and the cycle continues. 

But now, we can break that cycle. Web3 paves the way for this. We can now use blockchain-wallet technology to incentivize senders to pay recipients while sending targeted messages to them, and allowing recipients to get paid for their attention. 

**Attention is money. Introducing HelloX Network.**





# **2. About**

The HelloX Network is a wallet-to-wallet Targeted Ads & Messaging Platform that uses on-chain data to provide accurate message targeting. This secure network also rewards recipients with sender-paid messaging fees & spam-free, relevant messages. The message cost is determined by evaluating two key factors: the net worth within a user's wallet and their Social Influence Score (SIS). 

HelloX Network adopts XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) as its primary mechanism for message transportation. All communication within the network seamlessly flows through XMTP, leveraging its standardized and secure protocol for message transit. 

Messages can be sent from wallet to wallet with a fee paid by the sender. These fees increase proportionally to the receiving wallet’s total net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS).

</p>

As a result, the message’s recipient gets paid for opening and reading the message, according to how much their attention is worth.

# **3. Why**

In Web3, email can effectively be replaced by wallet-to-wallet communication. Any service in the Web3 “crypto” world often only needs a wallet address for signup. By providing the infrastructure to expand a wallet’s use, and an incentive-driven communication and messaging system, HelloX aims to address the following:  

* Spam prevention
* Accurate on-chain data-based message targeting
* Fair pricing based on wallet net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS)
* Secure, encrypted messaging with XMTP 
* Incentivizing message recipient for their attention
* Incentivizing message senders by allowing refunds for unread messages

# **4. How It Works**

The HelloX Network operates as a token-based wallet-to-wallet communication system. By analyzing on-chain data, it employs an incentive-driven fee system based on recipients' net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) to facilitate accurate and relevant messaging.

Here’s a glimpse into how it works.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - How it works" src="/assets/how-it-works.png" >
</picture>
</p>



## **Signing Up**



1. Sign up by creating a HelloX Network account by linking a wallet. 
2. The HelloX Network will scan your wallet, searching through its on-chain data to create a wallet persona.
3. Optionally, you can add more information like name, job title, company, etc., and verify your social media accounts to increase trust and build your reputation on the platform. Or, you can remain anonymous if you don’t want to reveal your identity.


## **Sending Messages**

Let’s say you are a new NFT project that has just launched some artwork. You’re seeking to market your project in a way that is effective but doesn’t bankrupt you.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - Message" src="/assets/message.png" >
</picture>
</p>



1. Figure out what type of wallet holder you want to target with the message you want to send. This could be anyone who would likely be interested in reading about the message's contents.
2. Search the HelloX Network’s extensive database, filtering for the desired characteristics of the wallet holder you want to target with your message.
3. It’s a good idea to create one or more personalised lists of wallets you’d like to target.
4. Identify any public lists to which you’d also like to send messages.
5. If desired, create a campaign: [Time-based](https://github.com/HelloXnetwork/Whitepaper/blob/main/README.md#time-based-campaign) , [Amount-based](https://github.com/HelloXnetwork/Whitepaper/blob/main/README.md#amount-based-campaigns), or [Time + Amount-based](https://github.com/HelloXnetwork/Whitepaper/blob/main/README.md#time--amount-based-campaigns). Set the fee budget and/or desired timeframe you’d like the messages to remain active for engagement.
6. Identify the fees required to send the messages. These fees are based on the total net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) of the wallet holders being sent the messages.
7. Send your message or launch your campaign!
8. If you receive correspondence back from a recipient, any messages between you are free from fees for 60 days.
9. The sender’s fees incurred for any messages a recipient hasn’t engaged with will be 100% refunded.


## **Receiving Messages**

A significant benefit of setting up your HelloX Network profile to receive messages is the ability to receive sender fees along with relevant messages—Your attention is finally valued! 

This is a fantastic way to make money while learning about projects that are likely relevant to you. 

You have two options: read the message or ignore the message.

When you engage with a message, it means that the sender succeeded in their efforts to gain your attention and you are paid the fee amount minus the system’s commission. Now, you have 60 days to communicate back and forth with the sender. 

If you see a message in your inbox and don’t interact with it, the sender is refunded the fee amount in full.

As a token holder, this is a great way to make money on the assets you’re hodling. Just connect your large bag wallets to HelloX Network, and the fees you receive for engaging with messages increase proportionally to the net worth of your wallets and Social Influence Score (SIS).

It is not just about Getting paid to read message. When someone pays to send, it's should be relevant and worth your time. It's all about the opportunities and deals behind those emails, that's the real deal.



<p align="center">
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/assets/engage-white.png" width='700' >
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/assets/engage.png" width='700' >
  <img alt="HelloX Network - Engage" src="/assets/engage.png" >
</picture>
</p>


This system significantly limits, if not eliminates, spam that plagues Web2.0 email inboxes. The relevance of messages should be notably enhanced through HelloX, designed to align messages with the assets in your wallet and the social influence your wallet carries across Web3 social platforms.


## **Message Transport**

XMTP ensures a reliable, open, and standardized infrastructure for transmitting messages within the HelloX ecosystem. This protocol enables secure messaging functionalities, end-to-end encryption, and an interoperable inbox accessible across various applications built on XMTP, forming a robust foundation for decentralized and private messaging across the Web3 landscape.

HelloX Network adopts XMTP, a secure and standardized protocol, to transport all messages. XMTP ensures reliability, end-to-end encryption, and interoperability across applications within the network, establishing a strong foundation for decentralized and secure messaging in Web3.

After the recipient completes reading the message, they can click the "I Finished Reading" button. Upon doing so, they become eligible to receive the sender's message cost. In the absence of action, the message cost is refunded to the original sender.


## **Message Cost & Slot System**

Messaging costs for an individual wallet are automatically calculated through a slot system based on the wallet’s net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS). The final fee structure will be determined by a DAO*, but an example of how this works is shown below.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Networth
   </td>
   <td>Social Influence Score (SIS)
   </td>
   <td>Cost per Message
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$1,000-$10,000
   </td>
   <td>10
   </td>
   <td>$3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$10,001-$25,000
   </td>
   <td>20
   </td>
   <td>$5
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$25001-$50,000
   </td>
   <td>30
   </td>
   <td>$7
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>$50,001-$100,000
   </td>
   <td>40
   </td>
   <td>$10
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The message cost is determined by both wallet net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS). For instance, if the message cost is $5 based on net worth and $15 for Social Influence Score (SIS), the final message cost would be $20. The final logic to determine the message cost for social influence and net worth will be finalized by the DAO.

 


## **Profiles, Persona & Labels:**

Every action on the blockchain leaves a unique imprint, collectively reflecting your interests and needs. HelloX connects to your wallet, scanning these imprints to craft a personalized profile for targeted, relevant messaging.

By analyzing your on-chain data, HelloX discerns your invested projects, their types (like NFTs, DeFi tokens, DAOs), and investment levels. For the Social Influence Score (SIS), it evaluates factors such as total followers, their net worth, posts, and engagement rate, forming a comprehensive profile.

This persona is then stored in a central database, categorized alongside others. Instead of unsolicited messages, the platform ensures you receive information tailored to your preferences, encouraging interaction and engagement.

## **Registration, Data Collection**



1. The user connects a wallet. 
2. The app scans & categorises the wallet’s entire on-chain data, creating a ‘persona.’
3. The data is stored in the HelloX Network. 


## **Sending, Receiving, Refunds**



1. Senders can browse personas to compile lists of wallets for targeting.
2. Messages are sent with varied fees, determined by the net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) of each targeted wallet.
3. Recipients engage with messages, earning fees for their attention or replies.
4. Unread messages prompt a refund of the fee to the sender, ensuring cost retrieval.


# **5. Features**


## **5.1 Multichain Support**

HelloX Network's primary objective involves scanning any wallet across diverse blockchains. This includes the capacity to incorporate multiple wallets, retrieving user net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) from various chains.

At present, HelloX Network seamlessly supports wallets and assets on Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. However, the network is actively expanding its support to encompass additional chains in the near future. This expansion ensures a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to gathering user data across multiple blockchain ecosystems. 

## **5.2 Social Influence Score (SIS)**

We understand that determining the message cost solely based on net worth isn't sufficient. Considering the wallet's social influence is crucial. To determine the Social Influence Score (SIS), the system analyzes multiple factors like total followers, followers' combined net worth, total posts, engagement rate, etc., gathered from Web3 Social networks such as Lens, Farcaster, Mirror, etc. This gives marketers significant control in targeting the right wallets to fulfill their specific requirements.  This grants marketers substantial control in targeting the right wallets to meet their specific needs.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - Message Cost" src="/assets/message-cost.png" >
</picture>
</p>

To reach out to influencers, they can leverage the Social Influence Score (SIS), while for investors, the wallet net worth can be a key parameter.



## **5.3 AI-Powered Search**

Hellox.network redefines audience targeting with an AI-driven search system. By eliminating the need for filters or tags, users can effortlessly find target profiles. Through simple prompts, our platform intelligently lists matching profiles, streamlining the process for precise audience selection. This simplified approach empowers users to efficiently identify and target their desired audience, making the targeting process seamless and effective.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - Prompt Search" src="/assets/prompt.png" >
</picture>
</p>

## **5.4 System-generated Cost**

The HelloX Network system automatically calculates message costs by considering a profile's wallet net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS). Unlike allowing individuals to set their prices, this system-generated cost ensures fairness in messaging expenses. By aligning costs with the profile's financial capacity and influence, this approach promotes equitable interactions while also safeguarding against potential disparities or inflated pricing, fostering a more balanced and inclusive communication environment within the network.

For example, the slot system that HelloX Network uses to determine cost could look like:

- Social Influence Score (SIS) : 10 | Wallet net worth: $1-$10K – $1 sender’s cost
- Social Influence Score (SIS) : 20 | Wallet net worth: $10-$25K – $5 sender’s cost
- Social Influence Score (SIS) : 30 | Wallet net worth: $25-$50K – $10 sender’s cost

## **5.5 Bulk Messaging**

Seamlessly send messages to multiple recipients at once. Effortlessly compose and distribute messages to specific personas or curated lists, enabling precise and impactful communication across the platform.

Effortlessly reaching multiple wallets with a single message streamlines marketers' tasks. Bulk messaging enhances efficiency by allowing simultaneous communication with multiple recipients, reducing the time and effort required for individual outreach.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - Bulk Message" src="/assets/bulk-message.png" >
</picture>
</p>


## **5.6 Multiple Wallet Integration**

In HelloX Network, users can connect more than one wallet to their profiles.

For example, if you have one wallet holding Polygon investments, and another with BSC project investments, you can connect both of them to your user account. This advantage is significant—the system calculates the cost of messaging based on the total net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) of all the wallets, allowing targeted recipients to receive bigger rewards!

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/assets/multi-wallet-white.png" width='500' >
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="/assets/multi-wallet.png" width='500' >
  <img alt="HelloX Network - Multi Wallet" src="/assets/multi-wallet.png" >
</picture>
</p>



## **5.7 Extensive Filter/Tag Options** 

What makes the HelloX Network so powerful is its ability to categorise wallets and tag them down to what types of assets they hold, their on-chain investments, and their transaction behaviours along with Social Influence Score (SIS). 

The data is then integrated into a comprehensive searchable database that advertisers & promoters can use to target relevant messaging to recipients, whether it’s NFTs, DeFi projects, or the latest stablecoin staking systems.



## **5.8 Time-based Campaign**

Time-based campaigns in HelloX Network allow advertisers and projects to set expiration dates for their messaging campaigns, automatically tagging them as "expired" messages in recipients’ inboxes based on a specific timeframe.

This feature not only saves the sender money but also prevents outdated information from being viewed by recipients.

For example, a project preparing for an upcoming ICO and wishing to inform supporters about the fundraising date can set the campaign to expire on that specific date. Any unengaged messages in recipients’ inboxes after that date will be automatically tagged as "expired" messages. Fees from unengaged messages will be refunded to the sender. This feature restricts unnecessary engagement, ensuring cost savings for the sender.


## **5.9 Amount-based Campaigns**

Amount-based campaigns in the HelloX Network allow messages to be automatically tagged as "expired" in unengaged users’ inboxes after the campaign's fee budget has been depleted.

This feature proves beneficial for emerging projects with limited funds.

For instance, a new project can allocate a budget (e.g., 10,000 USDT) to reach a targeted audience twice its size. Unengaged messages will be tagged as expired once the total fees hit the 10,000 USDT limit. Engaged users will receive their fees for interaction until the budget is exhausted, after which all unengaged messages will be tagged as expired.



## **5.10 Time + Amount-based Campaigns**

Time + Amount-based campaigns on the HelloX Network allow advertisers and projects to set both a campaign fee budget and a time limit.

​​For example, a new project with limited funds raising money in an ICO can set a budget (e.g. 10,000 USDT) and expiration date (e.g. March 1).
This combination of the “amount-based campaign” and “Time-based campaign” will make sure fees are still distributed to recipients until either the expiration date is reached, (March 1,) or the budget is depleted (10,000 USDT).
In this case, unengaged messages will be tagged as expired after the date or the amount is reached.




## **5.11 Personalised & Public Lists**

Empowering senders to curate 'personalized lists' from a vast database of wallet personas, the HelloX Network presents advertisers and promoters with a robust marketing tool.

In addition to the custom lists, HelloX Network offers public lists accessible for any user sending messages. These include compilations like "The top 1,000 Ethereum Holders," "Top 1,000 NFT Investors," and more, enhancing targeting capabilities for users.

  <img alt="HelloX Network - List" src="/assets/list.png" >
</picture>
</p>


## **5.12 Extensive Profile**


Within a HelloX Network profile, you'll find a dual data structure: user-provided information encompassing personal details and social profiles, and on-chain wallet data extracted from publicly accessible transaction records, encompassing asset holdings and the Social Influence Score (SIS). This integrated profile setup aims to present a comprehensive overview, combining user-contributed information with on-chain insights, fostering a rich and holistic representation of users within the network.


## **5.13 ‘No Reply’ Option**


One-way communication is valued when sending announcements and other messages. Users can do this by selecting a message as “No Reply.” Doing so allows the sender to send out one-way messages. Replying to that message is not possible.


## **5.14 Multiple Payment Options**

As HelloX Network transformed from a simple wallet-to-wallet messaging idea into a central Web3 platform for communication, the system’s team recognised the value of accepting multiple tokens for payment. 

Whether it’s in BTC, ETH, USDT, or another fungible token, HelloX Network allows payment of a message or campaign’s fee with any accepted currency. However, by using the system’s native currency, $HELLOX, senders receive a discount and pay less commission on fees.




# **6. Benefits**


## 6.1 Wallet-to-Wallet Messaging


While email has been the key form of communication in Web2, the next-generation medium of communication in a tokenized economy is wallet-to-wallet messaging. 

The HelloX Network aims to set the standard for this messaging while eliminating potential problems through incentivization. This system provides a database of wallet characteristics, obtained through on-chain wallet analysis, and a tiered fee system to make messaging secure, relevant, and spamless.


## 6.2 Targeted Ads / Messaging 

With HelloX Network, advertisers and marketers don’t need to guess whether their messages, funds, and efforts will fall in a void with low return on investment.

The system is set to build a comprehensive, searchable database of leads that can be filtered for unique interests. Each lead is a persona created by scans of wallet on-chain histories. Instead of sending a message to many who won’t care, marketers can send highly targeted and relevant ads, saving time and money.




## 6.3 Inbuilt Refund


Many marketing services and gimmicks don’t guarantee your money back if your message fails to receive engagement—HelloX Network does!

Every token counts, so the variable fees that senders are required to include with their messages are refunded if the recipients don’t engage with the message. This is all done automatically by the system to ensure the security of your funds, and an environment where you can experiment with what messaging works best with your outreach strategy. 



## 6.4 On-chain Data Relevancy


A wallet’s on-chain data, including transactions, assets, ratios of holdings, and Social Influence Score (SIS) form a unique picture into the token interests and strategies of the wallet’s owner. 

HelloX Network stores this valuable information in a trustless database filtered by interests and net worth to allow a marketing strategy with better targeting. This on-chain analysis is primed to revolutionise the Web3 marketing landscape.



## 6.5 Secured Network

One of the strengths of Web2 was the comparative ease of building a secure database by gatekeeping information in one area. However, a centralised database also is easier to attack and prone to purposeful or accidental human error. 
    
That’s why HelloX Network’s centralised database is accessible to no one but the user who the message is meant for—ensuring that the data is secure from bad actors and human mistakes. Senders and recipients can rest assured that their messages won’t be seen by any other person. 



## 6.6 Earn money

The HelloX Network rewards attention by setting a tiered fee structure for marketers sending messages. The sender-paid fee is awarded to the message recipient if the recipient engages with the message, giving the message attention. Otherwise, the fee gets refunded to the sender. 


## 6.7 Spam Prevention

It doesn’t matter if your spam filters are on—you’re bound to encounter irrelevant and annoying spam in your email inbox. Email systems try to reactively block these messages instead of proactively disincentivizing them. 
HelloX Network prevents spam by requiring payment for sending messages. The sender’s fee disincentives marketers from sending mass messages by placing a cost on campaigns. 

Also, the system’s reliance on individual wallets’ on-chain data provides critical information for advertisers and marketers to effective targeting without guesswork. 



## 6.8 Low Commision


 
The beauty of Web3 products is the significantly reduced operating cost, allowing more value to be transacted. The same can be said with the HelloX Network, which only takes 1% of total campaign costs as commission. This is far lower than the typical advertising network. 
 
Of this commission, 1% goes to $HELLOX holders who stake the token, along with project operating costs. 


# 7. Use cases

Here are a just a few examples of how HelloX can be used: 


- NFT Projects Engaging in ICO Details: NFT projects leverage this platform to communicate essential details and updates about their upcoming ICOs, fostering direct engagement with their community, ensuring transparency, and encouraging investor participation.

- Web3 Projects Targeting Whales & Influencers: Web3 initiatives utilize the network to specifically target high-value investors (whales) and influential figures for marketing their coins, aiming to expand their reach and leverage influential endorsements within the Web3 space.

- Marketers Exploring Secure Advertising Avenues: Marketers seek new, secure advertising pathways through the HelloX Network, leveraging its targeted messaging capabilities and secure communication channels to reach specific audiences without compromising user privacy.

- Wallet Holders Activating Their Assets: Wallet holders find opportunities to actively utilize their wallets, whether by engaging in investment opportunities, participating in campaigns, or leveraging their assets for potential rewards.

- Receiving Targeted & Relevant Content: Users with wallets in the network appreciate the provision of personalized and pertinent information aligned with their investment interests, ensuring a more enriching and valuable user experience.

# 10. FAQ 



**1. What is HelloX Network?**


The HelloX Network is a wallet-to-wallet targeted ads, and messaging platform that scans on-chain data to provide accurate message targeting. This secure network also rewards recipients with sender-paid messaging fees & spam-free relevant messages.

**2. What is 60-day free unlimited messaging?**

 
One of the more common questions we get is if a conversation of messages back and forth rack up fees for each message. This isn’t the case in HelloX Network due to the system’s 60-day free unlimited messaging policy. 

After a recipient interacts with a message and collects the initial sender’s fee, messages between the two entities won’t incur any costs for 60 days. After those 60 days, costs between each other resume.

**3. How can I earn money with HelloX Network?**

The HelloX Network rewards attention. This project recognizes that value is created when a message is read. As a result, message recipients on the HelloX Network will receive a fee paid by the sender in return for reading and/or engaging with the message.

**4. How does the HelloX Network prevent spam?**

Advertisers can send mass emails to people who don’t want them. However, in the HelloX Network, the sender of any message must pay a fee proportional to the recipient’s wallet net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS), significantly disincentivizing spam.

**5. What are the system’s fees?**

  
The true value of the fees required to send messages will be determined in the future by a DAO. However, they will be structured to reflect the net worth & Social Influence Score (SIS) of the receiving wallets. The higher the net worth & Social Influence Score (SIS), the higher the fee amount.

**6. What do you mean by “Inbuilt-Refund”?**

  
The in-built refund feature of HelloX Network automatically refunds a message’s sender the messaging fees if the recipient doesn’t engage with or read the message.

**7. What is the System-generated Cost?**

The cost of messages will be determined by the net worth of recipient wallets and their Social Influence Score (SIS). HelloX Network generates this pricing automatically for fairness.

**8. How are wallet net worth and Social Influence Score (SIS) determined?**

Net worth represents the combined value of assets held in associated wallets. Social Influence Score is determined by the net worth of followers and their engagement with the recipient's posts, gauging their influence within the network. These metrics are sourced from Web3 social platforms such as Lens, Farcaster, Mirror, and others.
